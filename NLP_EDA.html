<pre><code>Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: [&#39;cls.seq_relationship.weight&#39;, &#39;cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight&#39;, &#39;cls.predictions.bias&#39;, &#39;cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias&#39;, &#39;cls.seq_relationship.bias&#39;, &#39;cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight&#39;, &#39;cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias&#39;]
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: [&#39;classifier.weight&#39;, &#39;classifier.bias&#39;]
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
